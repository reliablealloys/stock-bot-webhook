# Fix for line 165 in main.py
# BEFORE (broken):
# size_match = re.search(r'(\\d+\\.?\\d*)\\s*mm', text_lower)

# AFTER (fixed):
# size_match = re.search(r'(\d+\.?\d*)\s*mm', text_lower)

# The issue: Double backslashes (\\d) don't match digits in regex
# Solution: Use single backslash (\d) to match digits
